# Chaos Mod Complementaries
A complementary mod for the GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod

# What is this mod?
This mod has some functionality that was initially implemented into the GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod (mostly the SA side of it)
because I didn't feel the need to create a new mod just for these things.

However, since the Trilogy Chaos Mod is being pretty much rewritten from the ground up (v3.0) I thought it would be a good
opportunity to strip some functionality out of it into a separate mod.

# What does this mod offer?

## GTA 3
The mod currently has no options for GTA 3.

## GTA Vice City
The mod currently has no options for GTA Vice City.

## GTA San Andreas
It currently has options to:
- **Disable music in interiors**
- **Disable** the weird **frame delay when the frame limiter is enabled** (14ms every frame, effectively causing the game to be in "25 FPS")
- **Skip** the **Lung Capacity stat check** for the mission **"Amphibious Assault"**
- **Skip** the **Fat stat check** for the missions **"Black Project"** and **"Green Goo"**
- **Skip** the **Gang Territories check** for the final mission **"End of the Line"**
- **Disable** the **cheat warning** that pops up when you have cheated and try to save your game
- **Disable** the **input of cheats** unless the **Shift Key** is being held down
- **Remove** the **tutorial help markers / pickups** at the 2 hospitals and police station in Los Santos
- **Keep your weapons** when you die or get busted without the need for the corresponding girlfriends (Denise and Barbara)
- **Disable** the on-screen blur that happens when you drive fast
