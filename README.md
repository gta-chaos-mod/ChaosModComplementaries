# Chaos Mod Complementaries
A complementary mod for the GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod

# What is this mod?
This mod has some functionality that was initially implemented into the GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod (mostly the SA side of it)
because I didn't feel the need to create a new mod just for these things.

However, since the Trilogy Chaos Mod is being pretty much rewritten from the ground up (v3.0) I thought it would be a good
opportunity to strip some functionality out of it into a separate mod.

# What does this mod offer?

## GTA 3
The mod currently has no options for GTA 3.

## GTA Vice City
The mod currently has no options for GTA Vice City.

## GTA San Andreas
It currently has options to:
- **Disable** music in interiors **and** some areas (e.g. the Lowrider meetup or dance party during Life's a Beach)
- **Disable replays**
- **Disable** the weird **frame delay when the frame limiter is enabled** (14ms every frame, effectively causing the game to be in "25 FPS")
- **Skip** various stat related checks for missions and sub-missions (check the config for more info)
- **Skip** the **Gang Territories check** for the final mission **"End of the Line"**
- **Disable** the **cheat warning** that pops up when you have cheated and try to save your game
- **Disable** the **input of cheats** unless the **Shift Key** is being held down
- **Remove** the **tutorial help markers / pickups** at the 2 hospitals and police station in Los Santos
- **Keep your weapons** when you die or get busted without the need for the corresponding girlfriends (Denise and Barbara)
- **Disable** the on-screen blur that happens when you drive fast
- **Allow** story races ("High Stakes, Low-Rider", "Wu Zi Mu" and "Farewell, My Love...") with **all** vehicle classes
- **Make the airport in the Desert super cheap** (Only $5)
- **Disable** the time checks in some missions so you can start them at whatever time you want (e.g. Life's A Beach, Home Invasion, ...)
- **Unlock** all cities and **prevent** the player from getting wanted levels in them
- **Remove** the barriers to and from the other islands
